### ‚ö°Ô∏èBasic Electrical Engineering Methods (Python Implementation) ‚ö°Ô∏è

This repository hosts Python code implementations for fundamental electrical engineering analysis techniques, such as **Nodal Analysis, Mesh Analysis, Superposition Theorem, and more**. 
It serves as a practical companion to a [YouTube lecture series]() where these concepts are explained in detail.



### üìö About This Repository
This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical electrical engineering concepts and their practical, computational application using Python. It's designed to help students and hobbyists:
- Understand the mechanics of circuit analysis methods.
- Implement these methods using popular Python libraries like NumPy

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è YouTube Lecture Series
This code is the practical side of a detailed video lecture series. Subscribe to follow along!

### ü§ù Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have a cleaner implementation, another analysis method you'd like to add, or find a bug, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
